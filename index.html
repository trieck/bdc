    <p> The BDC is an imaginary computer system intended as a teaching aid, to
        introduce the basics of digital computer organization. Its computations are based on the decimal number
        system,
        rather
        than binary, for easier comprehension. Nevertheless, it exhibits many features common to actual computers.
        <br/><br/>
        Following the <font color="darkred"><i>Von Neumann model,</i></font> used in nearly all modern computers,
        <font
                color="darkred"><i>main memory</i></font> holds both numeric data and encoded <font color="darkred"><i>machine
            instructions</i></font> telling the computer how to manipulate the data. Each of one hundred <font
                color="darkred"><i>memory cells</i></font> (in main memory) contains a <i>single</i> decimal digit,
        which
        can be
        changed. Also, each cell is uniquely identified via its (unchangable) 2-digit <font color="darkred"><i>memory
            address.</i></font> These addresses range from <tt>00</tt> to <tt>99</tt>. The BDC uses the standard
        <font
                color="darkred"><i>little-endian</i></font> convention. This means that whenever a multi-digit value
        is
        stored
        in main memory, its digits are stored in consecutive memory cells, <i>beginning with the least significant
            digit</i>.
        For example, if the number thirteen (13) was stored beginning at memory address ninety-six (96), then the
        cell
        whose
        address is 96 would hold the digit 3, and the cell whose address is 97 would hold the digit 1. <br/><br/>There
        are only
        three <font color="darkred"><i>CPU registers,</i></font> which hold multi-digit values, as follows:
    <ul>
        <li> The <font color="darkred"><i>accumulator</i></font> (A) contains two digits. It is used to hold and
            manipulate
            data during a computation.
        </li>
        <li> The <font color="darkred"><i>program counter</i></font> (PC) contains two digits. It is used to
            remember
            the
            main memory <i>address</i> where the <i>next</i> machine instruction (to be fetched and executed)
            begins.
        </li>
        <li> The <font color="darkred"><i>instruction register</i></font> (IR) contains three digits. It holds a
            copy of
            the
            machine instruction currently being examined and executed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    All machine instructions are three digits long. These instructions and their purposes are as follows:
    <div class="code">
        <pre>Inst.  Meaning  <br>-----  -------  <br> 000   Halt. (Terminate program.)  <br> 0??   Branch by an amount ??, by adding the number ?? to PC (?? != 0).   <br> 1??   Same as 0?? but only branch if most recent add/subtract caused overflow.  <br> 2??   Same as 0?? but only branch if most recent add/subtract did not cause overflow.  <br> 3??   Put the actual number ?? into A.  <br> 4??   Copy 2-digit value from main memory into A, starting at memory address ??.   <br> 5??   Add 2-digit value starting at memory address ??, to A.   <br> 6??   Subtract 2-digit value starting at memory address ??, from A.  <br> 7??   Copy 2-digit value from A into main memory, starting at memory address ??.   <br> 8??   Increment 2-digit value starting at memory address ??.   <br> 9??   Decrement 2-digit value starting at memory address ??.  <br></pre>
    </div>
    Addition and subtraction are always performed <font color="darkred"><i>modulo-one-hundred</i></font>. This means
    that
    some multiple of one hundred might need to be added to or subtracted from the answer, so as to force it to be
    between 0
    and 99. Thus two digits always suffice to hold the result. For example, 25 + 88 yields 13, since 113 is
    converted to
    13.
    So if 88 is stored in main memory, beginning at address <tt>54</tt>, and if 25 is stored in A, then the
    instruction
    <tt>554</tt>
    would cause the value in A to become 13. As another example, if 88 is stored in main memory, beginning at
    address
    <tt>54</tt>, and if 25 is stored in A, then the instruction <tt>654</tt> would cause the value in A to become
    37,
    because 25 - 88 = -63, but -63 would be converted to 37 (= -63 + 100). Whenever addition or subtraction requires
    this
    sort of adjustment, either because adding two numbers would ordinarily be bigger that 99, or because subtracting
    two
    numbers would ordinarily be negative, we say that an <font color="darkred"><i>overflow</i></font> has occurred.
    <br/><br/> Concerning memory addresses, the instruction descriptions in the above table are not exactly correct.
    The
    phrase 'memory address <tt>??</tt>' occurs in the descriptions of instructions <tt>4??</tt> through <tt>9??</tt>.
    However, whenever <tt>??</tt> is <tt>00</tt> in these instructions, instead of using the
    main
    memory
    cells whose addresses are <tt>00</tt> and <tt>01</tt>, the accumulator (A) is used. For example, the instruction
    <tt>800</tt> increments the accumulator. Moreover, when the first digit in <tt>??</tt> is zero, but the second
    digit
    is
    nonzero, <font color="darkred"><i>indirect addressing</i></font> is used instead. This is explained later, but
    it
    might
    be better to ignore indirect addressing at least until after you gain a mastery of the more basic aspects of the
    BDC.
    <br/><br/>Consecutive machine instructions are stored in main memory, to form a <font
        color="darkred"><i>program.</i></font> In this way, the BDC can be directed to perform a task, in a
    step-by-step
    manner. Each instruction occupies three consecutive cells. The machine instructions are ordinarily executed in
    the
    order
    in which they are placed into main memory. Technically this happens because, each time an instruction is
    fetched, PC
    is
    automatically updated by increasing it by three. Remember that PC keeps track of where in memory to find the
    next
    instruction to be executed. <br/><br/>However, instructions that begin with <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt> or <tt>2</tt>
    can
    alter this basic flow. They can cause additional updates of PC, thus affecting where to find the next
    instruction.
    An
    instruction beginning with <tt>0</tt> (other than <tt>000</tt>) can add any number to PC (modulo 100). This can
    be
    used
    to <font color="darkred"><i>branch</i></font> (jump) forward or backward, because of addition modulo one
    hundred.
    For
    instance, <tt>088</tt> means to branch forward by 88 cells. But, because of modulo-100 arithmetic, this is the
    same
    as
    branching backward by 12 cells. This means jumping back over the previous 4 instructions, including the
    <tt>088</tt>
    instruction. Admittedly, this takes some getting used to. Instructions of the form <tt>1??</tt> are similarly
    used
    to
    branch, but here the branching is <font color="darkred"><i>conditional,</i></font> and occurs if and only if the
    most
    recent adding or subtracting in a <tt>5??</tt>, <tt>6??</tt>, <tt>8??</tt> or <tt>9??</tt> instruction resulted
    in
    an
    overflow. Likewise for instructions the form <tt>2??</tt>, but here the branching occurs if and only if an
    overflow
    did
    <i>not</i> occur. <br/><br/><i>Ignore until ready:</i> The indirect addressing cases work as follows. Instead of
    using
    the cell whose memory address is <tt>0?</tt>, it is assumed that some 2-digit memory address has already been
    stored
    in
    main memory, in two contiguous cells, beginning at the memory address <tt>9?</tt>. This stored address is
    fetched,
    and
    it is this address that is used in the instruction, in place of memory address <tt>0?</tt>. For example, if 6 is
    stored
    at address <tt>94</tt>, and 8 is stored at address <tt>95</tt>, then the instruction <tt>804</tt> would cause
    the
    2-digit value stored at addresses <tt>86</tt> and <tt>87</tt> to be incremented. (The last canned program for
    the
    application
    demonstrates the usage of indirect addressing.)</p>
</div>
<div id="tab-2">
    <p> The application (below) emulates
        the
        BDC. The
        user is able to change the values in the main memory cells and the CPU registers, by hand. Each cell is located
        via
        its
        address <i>uv</i>, where <i>u</i> determines the row in the display, and <i>v</i> determines the column. There
        are
        also
        four buttons on the left, whose behaviors are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li><tt><b>STEP</b></tt> fetches a 3-digit machine instruction from main memory, copying it into IR. PC
            determines
            where to find the start of this instruction in main memory. Then PC is automatically updated, by adding
            three to
            it, to anticipate the next instruction. Then the current instruction (in IR) is executed, as detailed
            earlier.
        <li><tt><b>RESET</b></tt> zeros out the main memory cells and the CPU registers.
        <li><tt><b>SAVE</b></tt> allows the present configuration to be saved in a file.
        <li><tt><b>LOAD</b></tt> restores a previously saved configuration from a file, or else loads one of
            "canned"
            programs.
    </ul>
    Note that file I/O is generally not permitted when the application is executed via a web browser. Also, once the
    <tt>STEP</tt> button has been highlight, the enter/return key on the keyboard can be used to effectively depress
    it.
    Holding down the enter/return key causes a rapid progression through the machine instructions, thus emulating
    the
    behavior of a computer executing a program. The user can click on any of the cells that contain numbers in order
    to
    change these numbers "by hand." In particular, this allows the user to enter a program "by hand." <br><br> The
    main
    memory cells are color coded to help the user follow program execution details. Most of the cells are <font
        color="gray">gray</font>. The instruction to be fetched next is colored <font
        color="magenta">magenta</font>
    though. This is <i>not</i> the current instruction loaded in IR, but rather, the instruction that <i>will be</i>
    loaded
    next. It starts at the memory address specified by PC. When the user clicks the <tt>STEP</tt> button, this next
    instruction is loaded into IR, and executed. If this execution involves data in main memory, then this data will
    be
    highlighted in <font color="blue">blue</font>. If indirect addressing is used, then the stored memory address
    (used
    to
    find the data cells) is highlighted in <font color="green">green</font>. <br/><br/>Here is the Javascript

        (respectively). Each
        program's behavior is described prior to presenting the actual program code. Also, each instruction's behavior

            zeroing
            out z
            and then repeatedly adding <i>y</i> to it, while decrementing <i>x</i> and using it as a loop counter.
            This
            is a
            very inefficient way to multiply, but basically the only way available to this computer. It could be
            improved a
            bit though. How? Here is the program with comments:

        <li> Divides <i>x</i> by <i>y</i>, rounding down to the nearest integer. The result appears in <i>z</i> and
            in
            <i>A</i>. This is accomplished by first zeroing out <i>z</i>, then copying <i>x</i> to <i>A</i> and then
            repeatedly subtracting <i>y</i> from <i>A</i> while incrementing <i>z</i>. The loop ends when the
            subtraction
            causes overflow, because the result should be negative. <i>z</i> is then copied to <i>A</i>. Here is the

        <li> An example of using a loop and indirect addressing to add the data in an array. <i>y</i> holds the
            starting
            address of the array, and <i>z</i> specifies the number of numbers in this array. The sum appears in A.
